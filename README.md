# Intelligent Strength Coach

An advanced iOS fitness application built with SwiftUI that leverages the Gemini AI API to generate dynamic, personalized, and adaptive workout plans. This project showcases a full-stack mobile development process, from a polished UI to complex AI integration and local data persistence.

## Key Features

-   **Dynamic AI Workout Generation:** Users receive a custom workout plan based on their initial goals (e.g., build muscle, increase strength) and self-reported experience level.
-   **Adaptive AI Feedback Loop:** After completing a workout, the app can send the user's actual performance data (sets, reps, and weight lifted) back to the AI to generate a new, progressively overloaded plan for the following week.
-   **Live Workout Tracker:** An intuitive interface for logging sets in real-time during a workout session, complete with an automatic rest timer.
-   **Progress Visualization:** A dedicated "Progress" tab with SwiftUI Charts to visually track strength gains for specific exercises over time.
-   **Modern UI & UX:** A polished user experience featuring a custom, adaptive color theme, swipe-to-edit actions (rename/delete), a sortable list, and asynchronous loading indicators.
-   **Robust Local Persistence:** Utilizes Core Data for all local data storage, including user profiles, workout plans, and workout session logs.
